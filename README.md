(https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20221011-how-space-weather-causes-computer-errors)

- This article is called "The Computer Errors from Outer Space". It discusses the potential impact of cosmic rays on electronic devices. It cites instances where high-energy particles from space may have caused disruptions in computers and medical devices by causes a "bitflip". One specific case involves a cyber-security researcher, Marie Moe, who experienced issues with her pacemaker during a flight, possibly due to cosmic rays causing data corruption in the device's computer memory. It also talks about risks to self-driving cars and the difficulty of attributing accidents to cosmic rays. The article explores the rare occurrences of such incidents, the challenges in proving cosmic ray involvement, and the increasing vulnerability of modern technology, especially with the miniaturization of microchip technology. 

- Another cool example of a cosmic ray causing bitflip (that is not mentioned in the article) is a case that took place in Belgium 2003 when a voting machine reported that one candidate got 4096 extra votes.
